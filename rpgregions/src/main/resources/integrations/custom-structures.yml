# Should we automatically generate regions based on structures created?
auto-generate: true

# This is a group of template definitions. Templates are defined in plugins/RPGRegions/templates.
# You can use /rpgre to export a template region.
# The name of the file should be put here. The template will then be used to automatically generate a region.

    commands:
      # You must specify a list of commands that create a valid region in your current integration
      # {id} is replaced with the generated region id, e.g "demo_<random uuid>" and {world} with the world it was in
      # {minX} {maxX}, etc. is the generated min/max positions of the structure.
